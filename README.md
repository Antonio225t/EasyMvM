# EasyMvM - Update 1.5
This update adds a lot of stuff including the new `/mvminvasion setItem [ticket name]` that let's you add the ticket from ingame (it deletes comments in the `config.yml` files).
This also includes:
  - New lang keys `mvminvasion.setitem.success`, `mvminvasion.setitem.usage`, `mvminvasion.setitem.reset` and `noconsolecommand` (but console commands output are bugged, I need to fix them).
  - New command `/mvminvasion setItem [ticketName]` that allows you set the item for activate the invasion by using the item in your hand (if no items in hand then it will delete it).
  - New permission `mvm.invasion.setitem` for the player for running the `/mvminvasion setItem` command.
